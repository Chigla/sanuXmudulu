      <h2>Year 1</h2>
      <p>It all started when I joined the Discord server “Circle Outsiders” searching for some friends. How would I have guessed the girl using a matching profile picture with her then-boyfriend was going to end up falling for me.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1st date:</strong> We met around Grandee Hospital 🏥, held hands, and walked. Both of us were really shy but chatted nonstop—and I got matching bracelets for us.</li>
        <li><strong>2nd date:</strong> We returned to the same spot but then went to Bhutkhel Park. We shared our <em>first kiss</em> 💋, and I surprised you with a necklace and jhumka from my India trip.</li>
        <li><strong>3rd date:</strong> At Swayambhu I jump-scared you and got slapped—haha! Then we grabbed tea at a café and took a long walk to a park for some …naughty fun👅.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>4th date:</strong> We hit the BG Mall for our first movie together, broke our kiss record (almost 5 minutes!), and got adventurous 🍆.</li>

  <h2>Year 2</h2>
  <p>This year was a true “roller coaster.” With numerous ups and downs, fights and quarrels, kisses and blowjobs—this one stood out. 💖</p>
  <p>This year was tough and we nearly broke up—but thankfully didn’t. Those hardships made us stronger for sure. 💗</p>
