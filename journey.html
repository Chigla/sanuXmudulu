      <h2>Year 1</h2>
      <p>It all started wen I joined the discord server, "Circle Outsiders" searching for some friends. How would I have guessed the girl using a matching profile picture with her then boyfriend was going to end up falling for me.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st date: We met around Grandee Hospital üè• and held hands and walked. Both of us were really shy but we yapped a lot and it was a lot of fun. I got a matching bracelette for the two of us too.</li>
        <li>2nd date: We met around the same spot but went to Bhutkhel park and sat there besdies a hut. We had our FIRST KISS üíã on this day and it twas very cute. I had returned from India tour recently and had brought necklace and jhumka for you which suit you a lot.</li>
        <li>3rd date: We met at Swayambhu and I jump scared you so you slapped me haha. We then went to a cafe and had tea and then had a long walk to find a park to do some nasty things üëÖ hehe.</li>
        <li>4th date: We went to BG mall and had so much fun. It was our first time at the movies and we breaked our kiss record (almost 5 minutes) and even tried new things ykyk. üçÜ</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="year2" class="section">
      <h2>Year 2</h2>
      <p>This year was more of a "roller coaster". With numerous ups and downs, fights and quarrels and, kisses and blowjobs, this year was one of its kind. We both didn't really know what we were doing but that is the beauty of it. üíñ</p>
      <p>I don't remember specific dates here but we went on some really great ones. I think this was the year when we discovered Netflix and Chill too haha. And another major event was that we nearly broke up this year but thank god we didn't. Whatever hardships we went through then surely made us stronger. üíó</p>
